        "**1. What is a parameter?**\n",
        "A parameter is a numerical value that describes a whole population. It does not change unless the population changes. Example: average height of all students in a school.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is correlation?**\n",

        "Negative correlation means when one variable increases, the other decreases. They move in opposite directions.\n",

        "A test set is a part of the dataset that is kept aside to evaluate the final model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n",
        "We usually use the train_test_split function to divide the data into training data and testing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?**\n",

        "\n",
        "**13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?**\n",
        "EDA helps us understand patterns, missing values, outliers, variable relationships, and data distribution.\n",
        "It allows us to clean and prepare the data correctly before building the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. What is correlation?**\n",
        "Correlation shows how two variables move together.\n",

        "\n",
        "**17. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.**\n",
        "Causation means one variable actually causes a change in another.\n",
        "Correlation only shows a relationship, not cause.\n",
        "Example: Ice cream sales and drowning cases increase together (correlation), but eating ice cream does not cause drowning (no causation).\n",
